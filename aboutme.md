I am a Data Scientist currently enrolled in Lambda School, expecting to graduate Summer 2020.

I was born in Elyria, Ohio, but have since moved a whole 20 miles east to Lakewood, a suburb of Cleveland. I live here with my girlfriend and our two children (cats) Toph and Pedro. 

In the brief interludes between the school week and working the weekends, I find time to work out in my modest home gym, enjoy Lakewood with my friends, and have nights in (UberEats and Netflix) with my girlfriend.
