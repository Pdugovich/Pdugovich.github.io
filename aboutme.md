### A little about me... 
I am a data scientist with an emphasis on machine learning, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

Prior to becoming a data scientist, I worked as a wheel-chair ramp installer, and a toll booth worker. It was when I began working in a toll booth, that I really appreciated the way automation and technology can improve all of our lives. I was working in one of the most automate-able jobs imaginable!

I've always loved statistics, and the idea that individual data points might be meaningless, but if you have enough of the, and over a long enough period of time, you gain insights about the past, and even predict the future (within some confidence interval!).

When I'm not learning as much as I can about data science, you can find me trying to keep myself otherwise entertained in the confines of my apartment with my girlfriend and two cats. In another time, I enjoyed going to the gym, rock climbing, and exploring my city. Hopefully we'll be back to that time soon.
