 Do American's grocery spending habits change if they are supplemented by governmental assistance? Looking at the 5 items SNAP users spend the most on and comparing them to non-SNAP users, it seems to show there isn't much of a difference. A few ranks up or down here or there, but nothing too drastic, right? This table doesn't tell the whole story.
 
 
### Commodity and Rank of Spending
| Commodity | SNAP Rank | Non-SNAP Rank |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Soft Drinks | 1| 2 |
| Fluid Milk | 2| 1 |
| Beef:Grinds | 3| 6 |
| Bag Snacks | 4| 5 |
| Cheese | 5| 3 |

Rank comparison doesn't tell us everything, but does it tell us anything? Lets take a look at ALL of the differences between SNAP and non-SNAP rankings to see if our impression changes.

Wow! It looks like only the first few ranks are similar, then everything flies off the rails! Just looking at this graph, It seems safe to say that there are basically NO similarities between SNAP and non-SNAP purchases, and we should really look into what makes SNAP users so much different from _normal_ people...

But... once again, spending rank doesn't tell us everything. Rank is an ordinal value, so there's no context for how much greater 1 is than 2, or 2 is than 3. For all we know the difference between 1 and 2 is much smaller than the difference between 2 and 3. Luckily, we have some actual percentages of spending to work with. Lets see how it looks when we incorporate true percentages of spending along with ranking.

Okay, this really clears things up! Using non-SNAP purchasing as a baseline, it becomes clear that SNAP spending follows the curve pretty closely. There are still jumps and drops here and there, but the impression is nothing like the one we had simply looking at the rank differences. Still... those few jumps are really _jumping_ out at me. Lets get a closer look at some of the greatest differences in SNAP spending.

[Data from USDA](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/foods-typically-purchased-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap-households)

SNAP users spend significantly more on Soft Drinks, Ground Beef, Frozen Snacks, and Infant Formula than non-snap users. They spend a whopping 1.43% more on their total spending on Soft Drinks than non-SNAP users! 

Interesting! Now, lets do the same, but using SNAP ranking as the baseline to see what non-SNAP purchases jump out.

Nothing is as extreme for SNAP users, but non-SNAP users spend more on Refrigerated Dairy, Yogurt, and Berries than SNAP users. 



So, are food commodity purchasing habits different between SNAP and non-SNAP users? Sure, but aside from a few extremes, spending habits are not as different as we might expect.
